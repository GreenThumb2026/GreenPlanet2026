            <p> The oak woodland is the ecosystem that is known for its famous oak trees. One of the most
                domiant tree species are the Valley Oak and the Blue Oak. Oak woodland encompasses the central
                valley of California. Oak woodland ecoystems support a entire biodiversity of species. Oak
                woodland ecosystem is made up grasslands, oak trees, rivers and streams. In which is best
               discribed as riparian zones along river or stream banks in which certain species thrive. You will also
                find what is described as vernal pools. Vernal Pools are seasonal wetlands that fill up with
                water during the wet season and dries up during the dry season. My research is based on native
                species to Roseville California in Placer County. Rosevile California is located east of
                Sacramento California. Roseville California is located in the transition point of the Sacramento Valley
                and the Sierra Nevada Foothills. </p>
